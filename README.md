## Business Problem

The Ministry of Natural Resources of Tanzania is starting an initiative to improve their responsiveness and preparedness to water well malfunctions. The analysts from Global Water Alliance is building a Machine Learning model that helps predict whether a water well needs repairs or not. With this predictive model, the government can prepare the resources needed to do the repairs, from materials and communicating with the well’s funders and installers to attend to the water wells before it malfunctions. This way we can avoid water disruptions in communities and ensure they always have access to clean water.

## Data Understanding

The data is attained through competition on [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/). 

The dataset contains 57,000 records of water wells in Tanzania. There are 40 [features](feature_info.md) in the dataset and our target feature for our predictive model is `status_group`. 

The original dataset has been pre-processed and cleaned in this [notebook](https://github.com/hanis-z/Tanzania-Water-Well/blob/main/Preprocessing.ipynb) and loaded in here for modelling.
